## Running

The functions you are to fix in this project are annotated as `#[test]`, which means they only run in a testing context. To run the project:

```bash
> cargo test
```

This will run every test defined throughout the project. You can test a specific module though. For example, if you only wanted to test the variables module you could run the following command:

```bash
> cargo test variables
```

Or to test specifically one file:

```bash
> cargo test variables::variables1
```
